# US_Consumption_Habits

Understanding consumption habits is critical for marketers and investors. This project will explore how the U.S. consumers' behavior has evolved from 1929 to 2021. 

The goal of this project is to find out: 
1. How does consumption vary with Revenue and with other drivers ?
2. Are the variations in consumption mainly due to changes in one variable or many (Hypothesis Testing) ?
3. Do American residents adjust their consumption based on inflation during that period ?
4. How does the interaction between all variables and their impact on each other change between 1929 and 2021 ?
